Hello! This is a web-app project that I have been working on for at least a year now. It can be accessed on <a href = "http://jppeng.derpg.xyz">http://jppeng.derpg.xyz</a>.

<h3>What is the goal?</h3>
The goal of the project is to offer online access to people who work with the book げんき１ (And soon... げんき２) by The Japan Times. The site takes the vocabulary and kanji from the book and offers quizzes to the users. Users can generate worksheets to print off or work digitally and get graded instantly. There is a chart for ひらがな and カタカナ if needed for beginners. And if you are a developer who feels like command line is the way to go, it even has that (barely)!

<h3>Why is it on Github?</h3>
Why not!? The code is open anyways and anyone is welcome to contribute to it. :) My Javascript was terrible a year ago so I am sure there are some nasty segments of code that could use improvement. Soon, I am going to update it to fully fit the DERPG web-app theme.
